# ✨ Will They Make It? A Data Tale of Student Success

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project explores a student dataset to predict whether a student will continue or drop out.  
Unlike typical datasets with a ready-made target column, I engineered new features by combining multiple variables, cleaning, and transforming the data.  
The final pipeline applied several machine learning models and built a **Gradio interface** for easy interaction.
